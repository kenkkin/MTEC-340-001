## Synopsis

The little spirit, Ori, is no stranger to peril. When a fateful flight puts the owlet, Ku, in harm's way, it will take more than bravery to bring a family back together, heal the broken land of Niwen, and discover Ori's true destiny.

## Personal Connection

The Ori franchise is very dear to me, mainly because the first game, ***Ori and the Blind Forest***, was the deciding factor for me to pursue a career in video game audio. I have to pick the sequel game as my favourite, however, because it expands on the original so beautifully. Everything I love about the first game is still there, but now with quality of life improvements and so much more content. The sequel has so many more abilities, biomes, new charming characters, bosses, and even more. This game combines all of my greatest passions in life: stunning art, beautiful animation, unique sound design, fantasy narratives, enchanting music, and cute little critters!
